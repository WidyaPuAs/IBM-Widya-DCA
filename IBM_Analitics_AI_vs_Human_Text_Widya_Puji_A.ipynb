Their talkativeness (3.63) and party_liking (3.85) scores are lower, suggesting they may not seek out large social gatherings. However, their decent scores in friendliness (6.9) and work_style_collaborative (4.73) show they can engage with others when needed. The high reading_habit (7.96) and lower sports_interest (1.78) suggest a preference for solitary or intellectual pursuits.
